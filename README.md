# discord-server-bot
Work in progress Discord Bot made in Python. Probably very unoptimized. It's my first real project.
----------------------------
How to setup
1.) Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2.) Sign in and create application. 
3.) Navigate to "bot" option
4.) Generate token and copy it
5.) Open config.json and paste it in "token" section
6.) Create or find your welcome channel, and copy channel ID. Paste into config "welcome_channel"
7.) For moderation logs, do the same thing with different channel.
8.) Run main.py file
